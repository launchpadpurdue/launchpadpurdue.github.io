# Welcome to LaunchPad
LaunchPad is a one-on-one, semester-long mentorship program for incoming CS/DS students at Purdue. Mentees gain a community of like-minded peers and essential technical skills through club-wide events and a software project. We aim to ensure every student has the knowledge and connections theyâ€™ll need to make the most of their time at Purdue.
