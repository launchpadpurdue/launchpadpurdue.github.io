        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>LaunchPad is a community of computer science and data science students at Purdue University dedicated to learning, building, and growing together. We provide a one-on-one, semester-long mentorship program to help freshmen students hit the ground running. We pair each incoming student with a talented upperclassman mentor who will introduce them to the CS/DS community at Purdue and guide them in creating a technical project of their choosing.
          <br /><br />
          Throughout the semester, we host events to foster a sense of community and build technical skills. Our goal is to ensure that every incoming student is equipped with the knowledge and connections theyâ€™ll need to get the most out of their time at Purdue.</p>
